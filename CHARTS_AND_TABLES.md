# Chart builder and Table builder

## Files
Each builder consists of a create.html file, an objects factory and a renderer

Charts
- create_chart.html
- rd-chart-objects.js 
- rd-graph.js

Tables
- create_table.html
- rd-table-objects.js
- rd-table.js

Shared
- rd-data-utils.js


### Pattern
Both builders have the same pattern with functions split across their three files 

**Build:** Users set chart settings and data using the Chartbuilder (create_chart.html).

**Encode:** BuildChartObject(...) builds a ChartObject 

**Render:** renderChartObject(container, chartObject) renders a ChartObject on a page
